        ðŸŒŸHello! My name is Tauhidul Islam, and Iâ€™m a passionate Web Developer with a deep
        love for building dynamic, user-friendly, and efficient web
        applications. My journey into programming started as a curious teenager
        fascinated by how websites and applications work. Over time, this
        curiosity evolved into a full-fledged passion and career goal. I
        specialize in front-end development and have experience working with
        technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS,Firebase & basic knowledge of  backend technologies like expressjs, mongodb.
        Creating clean, responsive, and visually appealing designs is my forte.
        I enjoy turning complex ideas into functional, interactive web
        experiences.
